class TimestampDescriptor(object):
    """
    Descriptor that supports storage of high-resolution timestamps in a
    Django model.

    Many SQL databases don't have native support for high-resolution
    timestamps, and the Django ORM may not support high-resolution time
    even if the underlying database does. To fill this gap, we designed
    a descriptor that helps you split up a high-resolution timestamp
    into a database-native DateTimeField and a PositiveIntegerField that
    represents the fractional seconds part of the time as an integer
    number of microseconds.

    This allows you to work with the second-resolution part of the time
    in database-specific admin tools and the Django admin interface,
    while keeping the fractional part around in case, for example, your
    rows represent telemetry messages coming in at a rate faster than one
    per second and you need to keep track of their exact ordering.

    Example usage:

    from geocamUtil.models.timestampDescriptor import TimestampDescriptor

    class SomeModel(models.Model):
        timestampSeconds = models.DateTimeField()
        timestampMicroseconds = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
        timestamp = TimestampDescriptor('timestampSeconds', 'timestampMicroseconds')

    >> s = SomeModel()
    >> now = datetime.datetime.now()
    >> now
    datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 22, 7, 37, 16, 689212)
    >> s.timestamp = now
    >> s.timestampSeconds
    datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 22, 7, 37, 16)
    >> s.timestampMicroseconds
    689212
