class DelayBox(object):
    """
    DelayBox helps you intelligently delay things like cache flushing so as
    to minimize redundant effort.

    Example usage:

    delayBox = DelayBox(foo, maxDelaySeconds=5, numBuckets=50)
    delayBox.start()
    delayBox.addJob(1)
    delayBox.addJob(1)
    delayBox.addJob(2)
    delayBox.addJob(2)
    delayBox.stop()

    When jobCallback=foo, delayBox.addJob(1) is setting up a delayed
    call to foo(1) -- the delay is at most maxDelaySeconds. However, if
    you call addJob(1) multiple times before the DelayBox gets around to
    calling foo(1), those multiple addJob(1) calls are collapsed into
    one delayed call to foo(1).

    To improve resource utilization (e.g. disk I/O), the DelayBox
    implementation tries not to bunch up execution of all jobs in big
    bursts. It does this by dividing jobs up into buckets. More buckets
    should spread out jobs more evenly but also means the DelayBox wakes
    up more often.

    The argument type passed to addJob must be suitable for use as a
    Python dict key (e.g. string, int, tuple -- but no mutable types).
